Your task is to memorize the images as well as possible and to respond whenever you see an image that has previously occurred in the series.",

            "Press the r-key when you recognize an image that appears for the second time, aka a repeat.",

            "You have time to respond from the moment the image appears until the next one appears.",
            "When you press the r-key, the frame around the game will change color briefly. Green means correct and red means you made a mistake."
        ],
        "guidelines_final_notes": "Do not let the non-repeats trick you! Some images look rather similar. Only press the r-key when you feel certain you have seen the image before.<br>Aim for fewer than 7 incorrect presses. But do not worry if it is a little more. It is quite challenging.",
